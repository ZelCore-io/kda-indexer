# Operating kda-indexer

## Commands that write

`run`, `backfill` and `unwind` (and the hidden `tail`) write to the data directory. Each one
takes an exclusive lock on `<data_dir>/LOCK` and exits at once with an error if another
kda-indexer process holds it. Stop the service (`systemctl stop kda-indexer-<network>`) before running
`backfill` or `unwind` by hand. Read-only commands (`inspect`, `segments`, `hot stats`) do
not take the lock and can run next to the service.

## Halted chains

The tail follows reorgs up to `ingest.finality_depth` blocks deep. When a chain's fork is
deeper than that, lies below the frozen frontier, or is at a height whose stored hash is not
known, the tail **halts that chain**: it logs an ERROR with the fork height and depth, stops
following the chain and sets the hot counter `halted.<chain>`. The other chains keep
running, but the freezer stops for all chains (it freezes only heights that every chain has
passed), so the hot store grows until the halt is cleared. On restart a halted chain stays
skipped, with an ERROR line.

To recover:

1. Stop the indexer.
2. Find the chain and the fork height in the ERROR line (`hot stats` shows the counters).
3. If the stored branch must go, unwind it and clear the halt in one step:

   ```sh
   kda-indexer -c /opt/coins/kda-indexer/mainnet01/config/mainnet01.toml unwind --chain 3 --to 7390500 --clear-halt
   ```

   `--to` must be at or above `frozen_frontier − 1`; frozen heights are never unwound. To
   only clear the halt (for example after the node has settled on the stored branch), leave
   out `--to`:

   ```sh
   kda-indexer -c /opt/coins/kda-indexer/mainnet01/config/mainnet01.toml unwind --chain 3 --clear-halt
   ```

   `--clear-halt` deletes `halted.<chain>` only. It refuses when the chain's hot state is
   inconsistent: the `Tail` checkpoint has no stored header or a different hash, the tip has
   no undo record, or headers are stored above the checkpoint.
4. Start the indexer. The tail resumes the chain from its stored tip (or from the `Headers`
   checkpoint at `frozen_frontier − 1` when every hot block was unwound) and follows the
   node's current branch.

## Running under systemd

The package installs `kda-indexer-mainnet01.service`, one unit per network (Blockbook
layout): binary and config under `/opt/coins/kda-indexer/<network>/` (`bin/`, `config/`),
data under `/opt/coins/data/kadena/kda-indexer/<network>/` (see [install.md](install.md)).

```sh
systemctl start|stop|restart kda-indexer-mainnet01
systemctl status kda-indexer-mainnet01         # STATUS: "backfill r/n" or "tail lag N"
journalctl -u kda-indexer-mainnet01 -f
```

- **Readiness.** The unit is `Type=notify`. The service sends `READY=1` as soon as the store is
  open and the API is bound, before backfill, so a long first sync never trips the start
  timeout. Use `/readyz` (admin port) to know when it has caught up: 503 while backfilling or
  while any chain that is not halted lags more than `api.ready_max_lag` blocks.
- **Watchdog.** `WatchdogSec=120`. A dedicated thread pings systemd only while ingest and the
  API runtime are making progress: backfill and the range writer beat per block and per
  postings file, the tail writer on every commit and every 5 s when idle, the freezer per
  block pushed, the API every 5 s. The tail and the freezer count separately, so a busy tail
  cannot hide a stuck freezer. If a component is silent for more than half the watchdog
  period, the thread logs one ERROR naming it and stops pinging; systemd then kills and
  restarts the unit (`Restart=on-failure`). `kda-indexer serve` has no ingest and watches only
  the API.
- **Stop.** SIGTERM finishes the current commit, then exits 0. `TimeoutStopSec=120` leaves room
  for a freezer step that is writing. A step that needs longer is killed by systemd; the
  next start removes its unfinished files and redoes it (the freezer is crash-safe).
- **Priority and memory.** The seccomp filter blocks changing priority from inside the
  process, so use drop-ins: `examples/backfill.conf` (idle IO, nice 10) while backfilling,
  `examples/memory.conf` for per-host limits.
- **Enabled at boot, not started.** A fresh install enables the unit but does not start it;
  start it once the config checks out. An upgrade restarts it only if it was running.

## Moving an existing data dir into a network dir

The unit writes to `/opt/coins/data/kadena/kda-indexer/<network>`. A store built by hand, for example by
`kda-indexer run` at the top of a volume mounted at `/opt/coins/data/kadena/kda-indexer`, has `hot/`,
`segments/` and so on directly in that directory. To make it match the unit, move it one level
down. This is a rename on the same filesystem, so it takes seconds; it still needs the service
stopped and the lock released.

1. Stop whatever writes the store (`systemctl stop kda-indexer-<network>` or the process
   started by hand) and wait for it to exit. Nothing may hold `<data_dir>/LOCK`.
2. Create the target and move every top-level entry of the store into it:

   ```sh
   cd /opt/coins/data/kadena/kda-indexer
   sudo mkdir -p mainnet01
   sudo sh -c 'for f in .[!.]* *; do [ "$f" = mainnet01 ] || [ ! -e "$f" ] || mv "$f" mainnet01/; done'
   ```

   Anything else that lives on the volume (for example `lost+found`) moves too; leave it out
   by editing the loop if that matters to you.
3. Give the service ownership of the store:

   ```sh
   sudo chown -R kda-indexer:kda-indexer /opt/coins/data/kadena/kda-indexer/mainnet01
   ```

4. Check `data_dir = "/opt/coins/data/kadena/kda-indexer/mainnet01"` in `/opt/coins/kda-indexer/mainnet01/config/mainnet01.toml`,
   then `systemctl start kda-indexer-mainnet01`. The log shows the resume point (manifest
   frontier and the tail's stored tips).
5. Read the `run: plan` line in `journalctl`: it must show the old `frontier` and
   `backfill=false` (a store that was found empty would show `frontier=0` and `backfill=true`;
   stop at once if you see that and check the path).

**Alternative, no move.** Keep the store where it is: set `data_dir = "/opt/coins/data/kadena/kda-indexer"`
and install the drop-in `examples/datadir-volume-root.conf`. It replaces the unit's
`ReadWritePaths` so the sandbox opens that directory. Ownership still has to be
`kda-indexer`.

## Read-only `serve`

`kda-indexer serve` runs the APIs over a data dir that another process writes (a read replica,
or a look at a live store). It opens MDBX read-only, takes no lock and does no ingest.

```sh
kda-indexer --config /opt/coins/kda-indexer/mainnet01/config/mainnet01.toml serve [--data-dir DIR]
```

- Give it its own listeners (`api.*` in a separate config) so it does not clash with the
  writer's ports.
- It polls the node's `/cut` every 10 s for the node tips; `/readyz` is 503 while those are
  unknown or older than 60 s.
- It reports `READY=1` and the watchdog works as for `run`, if you wrap it in a unit.
- A reader never holds an MDBX read transaction longer than one request, so it does not stop
  the writer from reusing pages.

## Metrics and alerts

`/metrics` on the admin port (OpenMetrics text); the same families are written to the
node_exporter textfile when `metrics.textfile` is set (see [install.md](install.md)).

| Metric | Labels |
|---|---|
| `kdx_build_info` | version, git sha, network |
| `kdx_node_tip_height`, `kdx_indexed_tip_height`, `kdx_chain_lag_blocks` | chain |
| `kdx_chain_halted` | chain |
| `kdx_frozen_frontier_height` | |
| `kdx_ingest_blocks_total`, `kdx_ingest_txs_total` | mode (backfill, tail) |
| `kdx_stage_duration_seconds` | stage |
| `kdx_backfill_blocks_per_second`, `kdx_backfill_next_height`, `kdx_backfill_end_height` | |
| `kdx_reorgs_total`, `kdx_reorg_depth` | chain |
| `kdx_node_requests_total`, `kdx_node_request_seconds` | endpoint, status |
| `kdx_hot_store_bytes`, `kdx_segment_bytes` | kind |
| `kdx_disk_free_bytes` | |
| `kdx_mdbx_commit_seconds` | |
| `kdx_http_requests_total`, `kdx_http_request_seconds` | api, route, status |
| `kdx_freezer_runs_total`, `kdx_freezer_seconds` | op (freeze, merge) |
| `kdx_read_view_seconds` | phase (open, held) |

Alerts to set up in your own alerting:

- chain lag above 20 blocks for 5 minutes on any chain (`kdx_chain_lag_blocks`);
- any `kdx_chain_halted` equal to 1 (see "Halted chains" above);
- `kdx_disk_free_bytes` below 15% of the volume;
- a reorg deeper than 50 (`kdx_reorg_depth`);
- the comparison harness reporting unexplained differences over an hour;
- the unit restarting (`NRestarts` or a `systemd` failed-unit alert): the watchdog restarts a
  hung process and logs which component was silent.

## Before any big write

Before a backfill, a merge of many ranges, a rebuild or a replica copy on a host with shared
storage, check the free space of the volume and, on Ceph-backed volumes, `ceph osd df`: do
not start if any OSD of the pool is above 75%.
